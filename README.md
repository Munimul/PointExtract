# About PointExtract

PointExtract is a simple python GUI app that is written in python and uses QT for graphical interface. The motivation story behind this tool stemmed from the necessity of extracting points from a constellation image to accurately visualize in a CLI tool. That means getting the pixel co-ordinates of some points of an image and plot it with the same aspect-ratio. This tool also offers 0-360 degree rotation. So, any set of points can be rotated with respect to their mean position. The user can also save the coordinates as a list in .txt format to their local space for their need.
